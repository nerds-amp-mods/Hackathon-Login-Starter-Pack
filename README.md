# Hackathon login starter pack

set of pre-implemented login methods to plug and play for use in hackathons/prototyping

The aim of this repository is to maintain/implement user signup-login systems
to reduce time spent in re-implementing the aforementioned.

The flow is that there will be a set of backend/server options to choose from with similar
routes/endpoints and templates, the users can simply clone the repo and choose to use or
tweak with the existing end points.
